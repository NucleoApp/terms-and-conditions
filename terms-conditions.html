	</ul>

	<p>This page explains the terms by which you may use the Nucleo Icons and Applications (from now on “Nucleo”), a product of Amber Creative S.R.L. (from now on "Amber Creative", “us”, “we”, or “our”). By accessing or using Nucleo, you signify that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>

	<h2>Purchases</h2>

	<p>If you wish to purchase Nucleo, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your purchase including, without limitation, your billing address, your credit card number, and the expiration date of your credit card.</p>

  <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment methods in connection with any purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is accurate, correct, and complete.</p>

  <p>We may employ the use of third-party services to facilitate payment and the completion of purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

	<h2>Refund Policy - Nucleo application</h2>

	<p>The Nucleo Application (for Windows and Mac) is free. You can <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/downloads">download it</a> on our website and use it without purchasing the Nucleo Icons. The application includes a free subset of the Nucleo Icons, in case you want to test (i) their quality and (ii) how they work with the application.</p>

  <p><strong>Because the Nucleo application is free, no refund will be issued if you purchased the Nucleo Icons and you're unhappy with the application</strong>. The Nucleo Application and the Nucleo Icons are two different products. If you buy the icons, you can either unlock them via the application by logging in or download all the SVG source files on the <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/source-files">source files</a> page.</p>

  <p>If you're experiencing issues with the application, contact us at support@nucleoapp.com. We stand behind our products and will assist you in solving any problem you have.</p>

	<h2>Refund Policy - Nucleo icons</h2>

	<p><strong>Because of the digital nature of our product, we do not issue refunds on the purchase of Nucleo Icons</strong>. A preview of all the icons is available on our website and the Nucleo application includes a free subset of the Nucleo icons.</p>

  <p>Make sure to check the <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/premium-icons">icon library preview</a> and download the <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/free-icons">free icons</a> before proceeding with the purchase.</p>

	<h2>Refund Policy - Teams</h2>

	<p>You can request a refund within 30 days of your team account purchase.</p>

  <p>You're not eligible for a refund in the following cases:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>You (or your client) are unhappy with the Nucleo Icons</li>
		<li>You (or your client) no longer need the Nucleo Icons</li>
		<li>You don’t know how to use the Nucleo Icons</li>
	</ul>

  <p>If your team is experiencing issues with (i) the team management system and/or (ii) the project sharing functionality, get in touch for a refund. Please make sure to include the reason why you're requesting the refund. Before a refund is granted, you must allow us to try and help solve the issue you're experiencing.</p>
