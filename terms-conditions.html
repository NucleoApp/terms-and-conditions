	</ul>

	<p>This page explains the terms by which you may use the Nucleo icons and applications (from now on “Nucleo”), a product of Amber Creative Lab Ltd (from now on "Amber Creative", “us”, “we”, or “our”). By accessing or using Nucleo, you signify that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this Terms and Conditions.</p>

	<h2>Purchases</h2>

	<p>If you wish to purchase Nucleo, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your purchase including, without limitation, your billing address, your credit card number and the expiration date of your credit card.</p>

	<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment methods in connection with any purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is accurate, correct and complete.</p>

	<p>We may employ the use of third-party services to facilitate payment and the completion of purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our <a href="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

	<p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

	<h2>Refund Policy - Nucleo application</h2>

	<p>The Nucleo application (for Windows and Mac) is free. You can <a href="downloads">download</a> it from our website and use it without purchasing the Nucleo premium icons. If you have doubts about how the app and the Nucleo icons work together, we encourage you to download the app and try it for as long as you wish. The app contains a sample of the Nucleo icons.</p>

	<p>Because the application is free, no refund will be issued if you purchased the Nucleo icons and you're unhappy with the app. The Nucleo app and the Nucleo icons represent two different products. If you bought the icons, you could download the SVG source files at any time on the <a href="source-files">source files page</a>.</p>

	<p>If you're experiencing issues with the app, please contact us at support@nucleoapp.com. We stand behind our products and will assist you in solving any problem you have.</p>

	<h2>Refund Policy - Nucleo icons</h2>

	<p>Because the product we offer is digital, <b>we do not issue refunds on the purchase of the <a href="premium-icons">Nucleo premium icons</a></b>. To make sure you're aware of what you're purchasing, we showcase all the icons on our website, and we offer a <a href="free-icons">free sample</a> of the icons. In the <a href="downloads">premium icons page</a>, you'll find links to all icon categories and styles. Please make sure to check the icons before proceeding with the purchase.</p>

	<h2>Refund Policy - Teams</h2>

	<p>We issue refunds within 30 days of the original purchase of a Nucleo team account. Unlike the individual accounts, teams must purchase the Nucleo icons to access some advanced application features, like the project sharing tools.</p>

	<p>Please be aware that we’re unable to process refunds for the following situations:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>You (or your client) are unhappy with the Nucleo premium icons</li>
		<li>You (or your client) no longer need the Nucleo premium icons</li>
		<li>You don’t have sufficient expertise to use the Nucleo premium icons</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If your team purchased Nucleo and is experiencing issues with the (i) team management system and/or the (ii) functionality of the team shared projects, then please <a href="contact-us">get in touch</a> for a refund. Please make sure to include the reason why you're requesting the refund. Before a refund is granted, you must allow us to try and help solve the issue you're experiencing with the team tools.</p>
